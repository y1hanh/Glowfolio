    "Hi, I'm Yihan â€” a full-stack developer who loves building things that are both powerful and user-friendly. Right now, Iâ€™m working on my final year project â€” a platform that helps detect toxic language on social media. I believe technology should be a force for safety, connection, and empowerment. Iâ€™m currently looking for a full-stack role where I can keep growing, build user-liked products, and make a positive impact through tech.",
